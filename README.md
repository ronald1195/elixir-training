## How to Use This Repository

### For Workshop Participants

1. **Read the session guide** - Each session has `lib/session_XX/README.md` with theory and concepts
2. **Implement the exercises** - Functions are stubbed with `raise "TODO"`
3. **Run tests to verify** - Use `mix sessionX` to run that session's tests
4. **Check hints if stuck** - Hints are in `<details>` tags in the README

Example workflow:
```bash
# Start Session 1
cat lib/session_01_basics/README.md   # Read the theory

# Edit the exercise file
# (implement the functions in lib/session_01_basics/money.ex)

# Run tests to check your work
mix session1

# See which tests pass/fail and iterate
```

### For Workshop Facilitators

1. Check [TODO.md](TODO.md) for session preparation status
2. Each session has facilitator notes in `lib/session_XX/FACILITATOR.md`
3. Solutions are in `solutions/` (uncomment in `.gitignore` to hide from participants)
4. Run `mix lint` before workshops to ensure code quality

## Prerequisites

- Elixir 1.15+ installed ([installation guide](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html))
- Basic terminal familiarity
- Git basics
- A code editor (VS Code with ElixirLS recommended)

### Session-Specific Requirements

| Sessions | Additional Requirements |
|----------|------------------------|
| 7 (Ecto) | PostgreSQL |
| 10 (Kafka) | Docker or local Kafka |
| 11 (gRPC) | protoc compiler |

## CI/CD

This repo uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration:

- **Test** - Runs all tests on push/PR
- **Format** - Checks code formatting
- **Session Tests** - Validates each session independently

## Progress Tracking

See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for current development status.
